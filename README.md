# 2022 NTU Course: Adaptive Signal Process
teacher: J.L.Liu

This repo is a record of the course **Adaptive Signal Process**.

The rank got an A after a semester.

and the detail score is shown at below graph:

| categories | score|
| -- | -- |
| hw1 | 90 |
| hw2 | 92 |
| hw3 | 100 |
| mid exam | 85 |
| final report | 75 |

The rank score is calculated by the average of these 5 scores.

## HW1

The handwriting problems is shown in \<student id\>_hw1.pdf. The answer is not corrected yet.

The main code of coding problem is at **ASP_Wiener_MSE.m**. The main purpose of the function is to calculate the mean square error when user input a covarience matrix **R**, cross correlation vector **p**, weight vector **w**, and the varience **dn**.

## HW2

The handwriting problems is shown in \<student id\>_\<name\>_ASPHW2.pdf. The answer is not corrected yet.

The code problem is to implement different adaptive filters, including LMS, NLMS, and RLS. Here are two versions of code.

The files with term ASP_\<filter name\>.m is mine, and the files with term ASP_\<filter name\>_1.m are the code from senpai.

## HW3

The handwriting problems is shown in \<student id\>_\<name\>_ASPHW3.pdf. The answer is not corrected yet.

The code problem is to implement Kalman filter.
The main code is at **ASP_HW3_Problem_4.m**

## Final

The final asked us for designing a filter, no matter it has been mentioned in class, to recover the DOA.

The filter made by HHT performed not good at all. Dont use it anymore!!
